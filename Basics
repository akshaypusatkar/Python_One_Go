1)SingleLine Comment--> #This is a singleline comment in python just put # infront of line.
2)Multiline Comment--> 
"""
This is a comment
written in 
more than just one line.This is way to write multiline comment

3) Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.
4) String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes.
5) Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
	e.g., 
		1)	x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
			print(x)
			print(y)
			print(z)
		2)	x = y = z = "Orange"
			print(x)
			print(y)
			print(z)
6) To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function.			
7)You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), str() and complex() methods.
8)Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers.
			--> import random
				print(random.randrange(1,10))
				
9)You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes(single or double)
			--> a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
					consectetur adipiscing elit,
					sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
					ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""

10) The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end.
11) The len() method returns the length of a string.
12) The lower() method returns the string in lower case.
13) The upper() method returns the string in upper case.
14) The replace() method replaces a string with another string (all the instances will be replaced).
15) The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator.
16) As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers as datatypes are different.Hence use format() function for the same.
The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are.
		--> age = 36
			txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
			print(txt.format(age))
